# WITworks Review Board

## Introduction

WITworks Review Board is a web application which is designed by students for you, the students. The idea behind it is to a have completely centralized location for all your co-op needs. The application allows you to not only post reviews on your own experiences; but also if you are a newer student looking for co-ops or an upper classman looking for a potential job, it can give you a sense of what jobs are out that you can potentially apply for. As long as you are a registered student at Wentworth Institute of Technology, you will be able to access this site.
